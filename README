This is a simple Excel reproduction of a fivethirtyeight NFL Dynasties visualization.  I reproduced the visualization using Excel 2010.  I also updated to reflect the 2014 season.  Addditionally, I added the Super Bowl winners since no definition of a dynasty is complete without factoring in Super Bowl victories, IMO.
